# Console-Chat-App
This is my very first C# project! It's a console-based app where you can chat with your friends locally. 

This version uses the APM (asynchronous programming model)

### How it works

First, you have to set up the server that will handle the clients messages. 
You can do that by entering "s" in the message prompt when you start the app.

When the server is up, you must run another instance of the app as a client, by typing "c" in the prompt. Now you can pick a cool username and start chatting!
